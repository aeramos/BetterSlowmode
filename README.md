> A Discord bot that adds more depth and customization to text channel slowmodes.

## Overview
BetterSlowmode is a Discord bot designed to give users more power when defining slowmodes for text
channels. With the bot, users can specifically exclude or include certain members or roles to the slowmode,
and they can specify which types of content will be blocked during the slowmode: text or images or both.

BetterSlowmode is designed for as much customization as possible. Your slowmodes can be as short as
1 second, or as long as 1 year!

## Invite the bot to your server!
Coming soon! Once the codebase becomes stable and after I add more tools for automatically cleaning
up the database, you'll be able to add BetterSlowmode to your server! Until then, you can self-host
with instructions below!

## Install
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage
Run the bot with:
```sh
node main.js
```

Try some commands with the bot, use `%help` for more information.
```sh
%help
%set 1h 30m 10s --exclude @aeramos#0979
%set-image 1d --include @aeramos#0979
%set-text 1y
%remove
```
