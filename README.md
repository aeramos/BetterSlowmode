> A Discord bot that adds more depth and customization to text channel slowmodes.

## Overview
BetterSlowmode is a Discord bot designed to give users more power when defining slowmodes for text
channels. With the bot, users can specify which types of content will be blocked during the slowmode:
text or images or both. They can even specifically include or exclude certain members to/from the slowmode!

BetterSlowmode is designed for as much customization as possible. Your slowmodes can be as short as
1 second, or as long as a year!

## Invite the bot to your server!
Coming soon! Once the codebase becomes stable and after I add more tools for automatically cleaning
up the database, you'll be able to add BetterSlowmode to your server! Until then, you can self-host
with instructions below!

## Install
1. Install and configure Postgres server
2. Setup `config.json` (use `config.json.example` as a base)
3. `npm install`

## Usage
Run the bot with:
```
npm start
```

Try some commands with the bot, use `%help` for more information.
```
%help
%set 1h 30m 10s --exclude @aeramos
%set-image 1d --include @aeramos
%set-text 1y
%remove
```
